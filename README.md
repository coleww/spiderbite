spiderbite
----------------

a generative sequencer, intended for web-audio but ostensibly useful for other things

based on similar code that is currently running inside of [karaoke-ebooks, a website that writes songs out of your tweets](http://karaoke-ebooks.party), [drone club, a guitar tab player](http://droneclub.club), and [3 things, a generative dubstep single](https://coledubs.itch.io/blzrs-3-things) as well as probably more of my projects that I am now forgetting about
